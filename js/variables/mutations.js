    "Avian Ancestry",
    "Avaian features, such as feathers, may present themselves on mutated wyverns. They can range from full coverings to appearing only along joints and any amount in between. They vary in size, shape, and color, and physiology, so each avian mutation is uniquely different. These mutations result in lighter overall body structures, granting a more nimble frame that becomes more brittle, but much more agile in the process.",
