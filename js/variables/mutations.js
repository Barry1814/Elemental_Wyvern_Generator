    "Occular Accuity",
    "This wyvern has grown four eyes in straight lines on each side of its head to replace the two a wyvern would normally have.

  ],
  [
    "Avian Ancestry",
    "Avaian features, such as feathers, may present themselves on mutated wyverns. They can range from full coverings to appearing only along joints and any amount in between. They vary in size, shape, and color, and physiology, so each avian mutation is uniquely different. These mutations result in lighter overall body structures, granting a more nimble frame that becomes more brittle, but much more agile in the process.",
    "This wyvern -1 Constitution, +1 Dexterity, +10 Flying Speed"
  ],
  [
    "Delta Wings",

  ],
  [
    "Adaptive Carapace",
    "Sometimes, an incredible ability to manipulate appearance is present in some wyverns, with the skin beneath their scales having the ability to mottle its color and texture. This can be used to camouflage in to various environments such as mountain hills, grassy plains, or vast deserts.",

  ],
  [
    "Titanous Form",
    "Increased metabolisim and muscle density in their youth can cause some wyverns to reach a titanous size by adulthood, often growing up to twice as large as a normal wyvern. This, while it makes them proportionally slower in flight and less aerobatic compared to their smaller kin, gives them incredible strength and an astoundingly fortified constitution.",
    "This wyvern doubles in size and now has the Size Category of 'Huge'. Its AC is decreased by 4, and its Dexterity is decreased by 3. Additionally, its Strength, Maximum Strength, Constitution, and Maximum Constitution increase by 3."
